# insta-liker
A bot that likes all posts on a users instagram page

# program will halt once it gets to the last picture and likes it, because we are operating in grayscale
# when the heart icon in instagram has been clicked it fills red, but actually it will fill in black to the program
# and since our reference image is the heart when it's not filled, it will perform it's click function
# otherwise it stops

#note it doesn't kill the program so technically it is still running.
